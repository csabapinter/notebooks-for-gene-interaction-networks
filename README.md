- The Omnigenic Model is an interesting hypothesis suggesting that ALL genes expressed in a relevant tissue play a role in complex traits. 
- Scripts include clustering results of both complete tissue specific networks and subgraphs of core genes. 
- The main observation is how small subclusters of core genes and large clusters of the entire network (peripheral genes) form meaningful intersections relating to traits.
- This validates both the importance of tissue specificity and relevance of the omnigenic model.
